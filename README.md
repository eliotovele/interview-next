This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
## Writeup

I choose to use Chackra ui to build the user interface, because i believe it allow developers to build interfaces in record time especially i you don't have an eye for design.

I choose Axios to make the requests because it has wide browser support. Even old browsers like IE11 can run Axios without any issue, and since it was a small application i chose to useState to manage de states in the app.

## Note
I didn't manage to finish because i would exceed the give time which is deliver the code under 2 hours.
