## Writeup

I choose to use Chackra ui to build the user interface, because i believe it allow to build interfaces in record time especially i you don't have an eye for design.

I choose Axios to make the requests because it has wide browser support. Even old browsers like IE11 can run Axios without any issue, and since it was a small application i chose to useState to manage de states in the app
